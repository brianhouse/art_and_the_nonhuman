## Course Description
In this studio-seminar course, we will investigate the notion of nonhuman agency: geophysical and anthropogenic phenomena in earth systems, plant and animal volition, and the proliferation of machine intelligences. The work of contemporary artists across mediums will be presented for analysis and critique by the class, and we will discuss readings by philosophers and media critics. Research-based practices in the arts will be highlighted, and techniques borrowed from the sciences will be considered as methods of art-making. In addition to writing responses to weekly reading, students will incorporate the themes of the course in studio-based art for critique.

#### Objectives
- Gain insight into contemporary philosophical issues regarding nonhuman agency
- Survey contemporary artists working with science and technology
- Become familiar with research-based practices in the arts
- Consider contemporary culture through media representations of nonhumans


## Assignments and Grading

### Projects
This course is built around four projects completed over the course of the semester, which will be [critiqued by the class](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/master/resources/crit_guidelines.md). While there are technical and conceptual parameters for each project, you are expected to experiment and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. Projects must have a title and [3-sentence description](https://github.com/brianhouse/sound_art/blob/master/resources/description_guidelines.md), which must be turned in via Moodle along with a documentation video. As work is evaluated via in-class crit, no late work can be accepted.

### Workshops
Over the course of the semester, there will be many hands-on workshops in class. These workshops are the basis for learning the technical skills you will apply to your projects. Each will include an exercise to be completed.

### Presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on an influential work of sound art. These presentations, which must be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and then precede to show the piece, analyze it, and discuss its influence. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to the themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. Students will [sign up to present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPhcVVAViKSFwn7ufwh85ftbyqVCAH1wuNkG5fgo7ps/edit) on an artwork chosen from [a list](resources/artworks.md) on a first-come, first-served basis. Slides should be turned in on Moodle prior to class.

### Reading
Most classes will include discussion of short texts that address conceptual issues in sound art. You are required to read them before class and have questions and comments ready. Post a short response (1-3 sentences) online before class (asking a question about something you didn't understand is an excellent use of a post).

### Participation
Attendance is mandatory, and motivated and mindful participation in crit and classroom discussion is expected.

### Grading
In this course, you are expected to earnestly engage in the practice of studio artmaking, and doing so is the basis of your grade at the discretion of the professor. In other words, your grade is about process, not about product. Completing all work on time and participating in class is the baseline standard. Beyond grades, your work will be evaluated subjectively via peer critique and feedback from the instructor, and you are expected to incorporate that feedback into your future work while pursuing your own creative direction. Midway through the semester, students will meet individually with the professor to track their progress.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Access to 303
While all students must complete their own work, you are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours. We will choose designated open studio hours in the first week. Keys to 303 will be distributed to all students after Add/Drop.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and produced by you. Sampling audio is an inherent part of sound art, and learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming. However, you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' work wholesale. Always credit your sources and inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with science and technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways it capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
