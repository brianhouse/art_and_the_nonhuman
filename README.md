## Course Description
In this studio-seminar course, we will investigate the notion of nonhuman agency: geophysical and anthropogenic phenomena in earth systems, plant and animal volition, and the proliferation of machine intelligences. The work of contemporary artists across mediums will be presented for analysis and critique by the class, and we will discuss readings by philosophers and media critics. Research-based practices in the arts will be highlighted, and techniques borrowed from the sciences will be considered as methods of art-making. In addition to writing responses to weekly reading, students will incorporate the themes of the course in studio-based art for critique.

#### Objectives
- Gain insight into contemporary philosophical issues regarding nonhuman agency
- Survey contemporary artists working with science and technology
- Become familiar with research-based practices in the arts
- Consider contemporary culture through media representations of nonhumans


## Assignments and Evaluation

### Seminar Reading
Most classes will include discussion of short texts that address conceptual issues in art, science, and technology. You are required to read them thoroughly before class and have questions and comments ready. You will share these thoughts with the class.

### Projects
Over the course of the semester, you will compelete two artistic research projects—a midterm and a final—which will be critiqued by the class. While the projects must be in dialogue with the themes of the course, you are expected to experiment and to develop a personal artistic trajectory. Projects must be properly documented; in most cases this will mean making a video.

[More guidelines about projects](projects.md).

### Grading
In this course, you are expected to earnestly engage in the practice of philosophical inquiry and studio artmaking, and doing so is the basis of your grade at the discretion of the professor. In other words, your grade is about process, not about product. Attending all classes, actively participating in class, and completing all assignments is the baseline standard. Beyond grades, your project-based work will be evaluated subjectively via peer critique and feedback from the instructor, and you are expected to incorporate that feedback into your future work while pursuing your own creative direction. Midway through the semester, students will meet individually with the professor to track their progress.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Access to 303
While all students must complete their own work, you are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, students are also able to work in Fayerweather 303 outside of class hours. Keys to 303 will be distributed to all students after Add/Drop.

### Dynamic Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Accommodations
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with [Accessibility Services](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/accessibility-services) for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once you have your accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you to discuss the best implementation of your accommodations.

### Honor Code and Academic Integrity
By enrolling in the course, you agree to uphold the principles set forth in the College’s [Honor Code](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism), including the Statement of Intellectual Responsibility, the Statement of Respect for Persons, and the Statement of Freedom of Expression and Dissent. The work submitted in this course must be conceived of and produced by you. Sampling audio is an inherent part of sound art, and learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming. However, you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' work wholesale. Always credit your sources and inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
Our college is named after a white colonizer and is built in the Kwinitekw Valley on Nonotuck land; we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon indigenous peoples. As artists working with science and technology, we must be aware of and resist the many ways it capitalizes upon and perpetuates violence toward marginalized people.
